    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Chicken</h4>
        Boneless and skinless breast cut into small cubes</li>
        <li><h4>Vegetables</h4>
        Whatever you can get your hands on really. Some good ones to throw in include: <ul><li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Peas</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Onions</li><li>Celery</li><li>Broccoli</li><li>Onions</li></ul>
        <li><h4>Butter and Flour</h4>
        These will be the base of the roux (sauce).</li>
        <li><h4>Seasonings</h4>
        Salt, pepper, and celery seed will form a great base to go off. Add whatever else you'd like to taste.</li>
        <li><h4>Broth and Milk</h4>
        Broth and milk will deepen the flavour of your dish. Milk is also used in the roux.</li>
        <li><h4>Pie Crusts</h4>
        Two unbaked crusts are needed. You are more than welcome to make your own however store bought is perfectly fine.</li>
        <li><h4>A Drink to Enjoy (optional but highly recommended)</h4></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Make the Filling</h4>
        Boil the cubed chicken with your Vegetables (<strong>Not</strong> the onions!) for about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. Cook the onions in butter till they are translucent, then stir in the flour and seasonings. Add chicken broth and milk and let it simmer until it is at your desired thickness. <strong>Keep the cooked veggies and the sauce separate for now.</strong></li>
        <li><h4>Fill and Bake the Pie</h4>
        Place the chicken veggie mix in an unbaked pie crust. Pour the chicken broth mixture overtop. Cover top with the top crust, seal the edges (pinching works good), and cut slits in the top (to let steam escape). Bake until the pastry is a golden brown and filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li><h4>Drink Wine and Bask</h4>
        You're basically done already! Sit back, wait for the pie to crisp up, and enjoy!</li>
