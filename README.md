# odin-recipes

This is the culmination of my Odin Project learnings so far. 

I shall be using what I have learnt to create a website containing a main index page including links to various pages. 

Still very very new. Learning how to write GOOD commit messages is a bit challenging.

[INSERT WHAT TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED HERE]

All links are not owned by me and all their rights belong to them not me. I am using these for educational purposes.
